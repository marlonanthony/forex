## Currency Exchange

This is a fullstack app built with GraphQL, Apollo, React, MongoDB, and Node.js. This project has two accompanying articles that go over how to create this app in detail. One [article](https://dev.to/marlonanthony/let-s-build-a-currency-exchange-part-i-52g1) covers the backend, the other the front (coming soon). Feel free to [reach out](https://twitter.com/marlonanthony10) with any questions or improvements.
